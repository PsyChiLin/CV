# EDUCATION

University of Michigan (UM), Ann Arbor, United States \hfill 2019/9-2024/8(Expected)

Degree: Ph.D. Psychology, Developmental Area

National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan \hfill 2017/2-2018/6

Degree: M.S. Psychology (Thesis: *“Neural Correlates of Theory of Mind in Typically Developing Youths and Youths with Autism Spectrum Disorder”*)

National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan  \hfill 2012/9-2016/7

Degree: B.S. Psychology

# RESEARCH INTERESTS
I focus on social cognition in children and adults via behavioral experiments, neuroimaging techniques, and computational modeling. Specific topics include the underlying mechanism of Theory of Mind (ToM), the development of ToM, and how ToM becomes dysfunctional in clinical populations.
