## Chi-Lin Yu - CV

This repository contains the files that used to create Chi-Lin Yu's CV. R markdown and `knitr` are major tools. PDF output requires `TeX` (`MikTeX` on Windows; `MacTex` on macOS). The `xeCJK` TeX package should be installed for building fonts in Taiwanese Mandarin (e.g., 標楷體).

In this repository, a full version CV in English can be found. Also, a Taiwan Mandarin version is provided for demonstration purposes.
